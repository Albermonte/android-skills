- Color Color values are implemented through design tokens. For designers, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens; in implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. Learn more about design tokens
- States States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or an interactive element. The navigation item's target area always spans the full width of the nav rail, even if the item container hugs its contents.

- Configurations Common arrangements of elements within a navigation rail.
- The navigation rail can display navigation items, a menu, and a floating action button (FAB) in a vertical orientation. There are two variants of navigation rails, collapsed and expanded , which can easily transform into each other when the menu button is selected. Collapsed The collapsed nav rail runs along the leading edge of the window, and should contain 3-7 navigation items. It should not be hidden. It can be used in medium to extra large window sizes, such as tablets and desktop. In medium windows with few destinations, consider using a navigation bar instead. Compact windows should always use a navigation bar.
- Information dense layouts where space is limited
- Products with many navigation items
- In immersive experiences, the expanded navigation rail can be hidden entirely, appearing only when the menu icon is selected. The collapsed navigation rail should not be hidden.
- Container The navigation rail should be placed on the leading edge of the window. This is the left side for left-to-right languages, and the right side for right-to-left languages. The container fill can be turned off so the nav rail appears directly on the surface. When doing this, make sure all items have a minimum of 3:1 color contrast.
- The navigation rail should always run vertically along the side of a layout. Don't make it horizontal. Use a navigation bar for horizontal navigation.
- Navigation rail items can be aligned as a group to the top or center of a layout. On tablets, use center alignment to make it easier to reach items. The menu icon and FAB should always be top-aligned.
- Menu (optional) The menu button can transition between the collapsed and expanded navigation rails. Once expanded, the rail can reveal secondary destinations. When the navigation rail is expanded, the menu icon should change to represent that it can be collapsed.
- Floating action button (FAB) (optional) The container of the navigation rail is ideal for anchoring the FAB to the top of a screen, placing the app's key action above navigation destinations. When nested within another component, such as the navigation rail, the FAB's resting elevation should be level 0 .
- The top of the rail can also be used for a logo, however avoid using logos that could be mistaken as buttons. Don't use a logo as a menu button to expand the navigation rail.
- Active indicator The active indicator shows which page is being displayed.
- The active indicator hugs the label text in the expanded nav rail. To achieve a similar style to the baseline navigation drawer, consider modifying the active indicator to fill the container. The target area should always span the full width.
- Icons Navigation rail items must use icons that symbolize the content of their page. Browse popular icons on Google Fonts .
- When a destination is selected, the icon fills and changes color. An active indicator appears behind the icon.
- Label text The label text should be a short, meaningful description of each navigation destination and another way for users to understand an icon's meaning. All navigation items require a one word label text.
- Avoid wrapping long labels when possible. If necessary, create a line break between words, or hyphenate longer words.
- Labels should be short enough to not be truncated. Don't shrink the type scale to fit longer text labels.
- Badges Navigation rail icons can include badges to communicate dynamic information about the destination, such as counts or status. In compact nav rails, the badge is placed in the upper right corner of the icon. In expanded nav rails, the badge should be placed next to the label text.
- Divider (optional) A vertical divider can help separate the rail from app content. The divider should be positioned on the edge of the rail container that's adjacent to the app's content area.
- In adaptive layouts, the navigation rail should be placed outside any panes, always along the leading edge of the window. Don't place it within body content. When the navigation rail is hidden, the body content can fill in the remaining space as long as the menu icon is still accessible. Tabs can be used alongside a navigation rail to create an extra layer of visible navigation.
- For more, see adaptive design .
- Resizing When moving from a large screen to a small screen, a navigation rail can transform into a navigation bar, providing the same quick access in a configuration that's easier to use on smaller displays. Never use the navigation rail and navigation bar simultaneously. Only use navigation rails for medium window size classes and larger. Don't use a navigation bar. If there are more than five destinations, consider using a modal expanded nav rail instead. Compact: Don't use a standard navigation rail for compact layouts due to space constraints. Use a navigation bar instead. Medium: Use a navigation rail, especially if prioritizing persistent vertical navigation over maximizing vertical content space. Expanded to extra-large: Use a navigation rail, not a navigation bar. Consider available horizontal space and the number of destinations when choosing between standard and modal.
- Presentation When the navigation rail transitions from collapsed to expanded, the contents of the page should automatically adjust to fit. The contents of the navigation rail also expand to fill the space. For example, the FAB should transition into an extended FAB. Extra destinations can be shown in an expanded nav rail.
- Scrolling Destinations in the navigation rail should remain visible and fixed when scrolling vertically.
- If a layout scrolls horizontally, the rail can scroll off-screen or remain fixed. To distinguish that content is scrolling underneath the rail, use a divider or add elevation to the rail.
- Selection When a destination is tapped, the destination screen uses a top level transition pattern. In addition, the icon becomes filled and the active indicator expands from the center of the icon.
- Previous screen is revealed in a preview to signal the destination
- Predictive back only applies to the modal expanded navigation rail.
- A touch ripple appears
- The outgoing icon color changes from a brand color to grey
- The outgoing icon moves down to align with the deactivated tabs, and then the label fades out
- The incoming icon color changes from grey to a brand color

- Extended reality (XR) interfaces have special design requirements, like showing apps in 3D space. Material has XR-specific navigation rails with custom specs and guidance. See XR developer documentation for more details.
- There are two variants of navigation rail orbiters: the contained FAB and spatialized FAB navigation rails.
- Color & elevation
- On XR, color is used to highlight elevated UI elements and orbiters. With spatial elevation , the navigation bar displays above the spatial panel, on the Z-axis. Color communicates elevation on UI elements and orbiters. Elevated nav rails can use any of these color options:
- In full space, a navigation rail can appear in an orbiter for a more immersive experience. Currently, spatial capabilities, such as orbiters, are only available in full space. In home space, use a regular navigation rail on the same plane as the body content to mimic a 2D experience.
- Global context Intended for global navigation, a nav rail orbiter should be centered along the left or right edge of the app it controls. It stays anchored to the app during layout or content changes to ensure controls are easy to find.
- Local context Don't place a navigation rail orbiter in local context or between spatial panels . Local placement can make controls hard to find. Nav rails are designed for app-level navigation, so should only use the global context.
- Use offset positioning for global actions that affect the overall app experience
- Use inset positioning for local actions that are specific to a spatial panel
- Inset positioning Don't obstruct content. To ensure a balanced and uncluttered layout, a navigation rail orbiter should overlap spatial panels by 12dp and no more than half their width.
- Vertical alignment A navigation rail orbiter can be aligned to the top, middle, or center of spatialized panels, providing different levels of visual prominence and accessibility. Align the navigation rail orbiter based on the specific design and user experience goals for the application.
- The navigation rail orbiter placement shouldn't exceed the height of adjacent spatial panels.
- Spatial panel alignment Avoid placing a navigation rail orbiter between spatial panels. This negatively affects the interface structure. For layouts that span more than two spatial panels, consider using a navigation bar orbiter.
- Contained FAB rail: A contained FAB within the rail. This offers a compact and familiar layout.
- Spatialized FAB rail: The FAB becomes an orbiter of it's own and is placed outside the navigation rail orbiter. Use this for higher emphasis and a distinct spatial effect.
- To maintain visual association, place the spatialized FAB in close proximity to the navigation rail orbiter. Material recommends a 20dp margin. The spatialized FAB can be placed above or below the navigation rail orbiter.
- While the spatialized FAB and navigation rail orbiter are typically positioned together, their placement is adaptable.
- XR accessibility guidelines are still evolving. XR navigation rails should follow applicable Material nav rail accessibility standards .
- Navigate between navigation destinations
- Select a particular navigation destination from a set
- Get appropriate feedback based on input type
- Interaction & style
- A ripple passes through the indicator
- The icon switches from outlined to filled
- The icon and text change color
- The target area for expanded navigation rails spans the full width of the container, even though the active indicator visually hugs the content.
- Use a filled icon for the active destination and outlined icons for inactive destinations. Active and inactive icon colors need sufficient contrast against the container.
- If an icon doesn't have a filled style, use the semibold icon weight instead.
- Text scaling and truncation When someone sets their device to show a larger text size, the navigation rail items should grow vertically to accommodate larger labels while retaining the default padding. It's okay for scaled text to wrap in navigation items. To remain accessible, ensure the full label is always visible on-screen at up to 2x text sizing. Beyond this size, text can truncate.
- Initial focus Initial focus lands directly on the first interactive item, whether it's the menu, the FAB, or the first navigation item. From the FAB or menu, Tab brings the person to the navigation items. Tab or Arrows then navigate between items.
- Visual indicators Icons give the dominant cue of the navigation state. Use a filled icon for the selected destination to contrast with outlined icons for the non-selected destinations.
- Keyboard navigation Keys Actions Tab / Arrows Navigate between interactive elements Space / Enter Selects an interactive element
- Labeling elements The accessibility label for a navigation item is typically the same as the adjacent text label. When the visible UI text is ambiguous, accessibility labels need to be more descriptive. For example, a navigation item visibly labeled Recent would benefit from additional information in its accessibility label to clarify the destination's intent. Note: On MDC-Android , a more descriptive accessibility label is not available and the role is not announced.
