- M3 Expressive update
- May 2025 Updated M3 type scale with emphasized styles Material's type scale includes fifteen baseline type styles, the same as before, and fifteen new emphasized type styles. The emphasized type styles add more expression to highlighted moments. Roboto Flex can be used on its own to show a range of emotional states, but is not yet part of the M3 typescale.

- Emphasized type style tokens Design tokens offer an improved way to define typography in products by assigning an element's type style by a configurable value, rather than a set value. Emphasized tokens allow for clearer hierarchies and prioritized components within a layout. Type roles describe size-such as small, medium, and large-enabling them to adapt and respond to the device or context.
- Previous updates
- Variable fonts Roboto Flex, Roboto Serif, & Roboto Mono Updated considerations for using variable fonts and different combinations of their customizable axes, including grade, width, weight, slant, and optical size.
- Style roles Type styles are defined by five roles: display, headline, title, body, and label. These names are more descriptive, allowing for easier matching of type style to use case.
- Static fonts like Roboto are currently applied by default to all Material 3 components. Variable fonts like Roboto Flex have many more axes for expression, but aren't yet part of the M3 typescale.
- Default typefaces
- Roboto Roboto is the default typeface for Android, and is used in the M3 typescale . Roboto includes over 3,300 glyphs for representing hundreds of languages around the world.
- Roboto Flex Roboto Flex is a variable font which adds more flexibility to typography. It has an extended range of weights, widths, and additional customizable attributes (like size-specific designs), and includes over 900 glyphs with support for Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. Roboto Flex is available as a standalone font.
- Roboto Serif Roboto Serif is another variable font family, designed to create a comfortable reading experience. Minimal and highly functional, it can be used anywhere (even in app interfaces) due to its extensive set of weights and widths across a broad range of sizes.
- Roboto Mono Roboto Mono is a monospaced version of the classic Roboto design. Being monospaced means each letter has equal space, and letterforms are adjusted to properly fill the space. Monospaced fonts are easier to scan vertically, so are particularly useful for code and keeping numbers aligned. Learn more about monospaced numbers
- Noto Sans Noto Sans is a global font collection for all modern and ancient languages. Each Noto Sans family is compatible with Roboto and Noto Sans supports more than 150 scripts and thousands of languages. It is used as a "fallback" font, when a language is unsupported.

- Variable font Available axes Roboto Flex Slant, Width, Weight, Grade, Optical Size. Advanced axes : Thick stroke (XOPQ), thin stroke (YOPQ), counter width (XTRA), uppercase height (YTUC), lowercase height (YTLC), ascender height (YTAS), descender depth (YTDE), figure height (YTFI) Roboto Mono Weight, Italic Noto Sans Width, Weight, Italic
- Fallback protection with variable fonts
- Font fallback is when a similar font is used as a replacement when the current font doesn't support the text's characters.

- Type scale
- A type scale is a selection of type styles used across a product to ensure consistency.
- M3 type scale
- Material 3 has one type scale containing two sets of type styles: 15 baseline and 15 emphasized . Both of these style sets follow the same scale from Display Large to Label Small. The emphasized styles were added in the expressive update. They have a higher weight and other minor adjustments compared to the baseline styles, and are best applied to bold, selection, and other areas of emphasis. Baseline and emphasized styles are meant to be used together.
- Type scale tokens
- Each of the 30 styles has a single token that captures all the default properties. Tokens are separated into the baseline and emphasized sets. Each axis and property, such as font, line height, size, tracking, and weight, also has an individual token for greater customization. Learn more about design tokens
- Baseline type style tokens
- Emphasized type styles
- The M3 type scale has 15 emphasized type styles. Use both baseline and emphasized type styles together to achieve expressive experiences. Material recommends using emphasized styles for selection, actions, headlines, and other editorial treatments .
- Emphasized type style tokens
- Where emphasized styles can be used
- Badges
- Buttons (for primary actions)
- Extended FAB
- Selected list items
- Selected menu items
- Baseline: md.sys.typescale.display-large
- Emphasized: md.sys.typescale. emphasized .display-large
- Weight Use the emphasized styles on text that already uses weight (such as medium, bold) to communicate hierarchy. Context Use emphasized styles to draw attention to specifics aspects of components, such as selected states, unread messages, or key interactions. Emphasized context and weight can be used at the same time.
- Customize the typeface
- The brand typeface is used for larger type styles, like Headline and Display, to focus on expression.
- The plain typeface is used for smaller type styles, like Body and Label, to focus on readability.
- Roboto is the default for both typefaces.
- Brand and plain typeface tokens
- Customizing type styles
- If using a different typeface, change the brand and plain typeface tokens.
- Adjust properties like line height and letter spacing to refine the appearance. Avoid changing the type size; this can affect how components render and reflow.
- Repeat for both baseline and emphasized type styles. Try to keep emphasized styles visually consistent, like all wider than baseline.
- Different typefaces can be used for baseline and emphasized type styles.
- Customizing your type scale
- When different sizes from the defaults are needed, such as for different devices, you can customize the type scale by adding or removing styles, and even swapping out Roboto for a font of your choice.
- Material Design uses the Major Second type scale with 14 as its key base size. This anchors to the most essential style used most often for typesetting body text.
- Sizes on the rendered type scale should aim to provide impactful contrast between sizes by avoiding small differences.
- Font size units The following units are used to express font size on Android and the web.
- Platform Android Web Font size unit sp rem Conversion ratio 1.0 0.0625 Web browsers calculate the REM (the root em size) based on the root element size. The default for modern web browsers is 16px, so the conversion is SP_SIZE/16 = rem.
- Example conversions Android Web 10sp 0.625rem 12sp 0.75rem 24sp 1.5rem 60sp 3.75rem
- Letter spacing units The following units are for spacing letters in a UI.
- Platform Android Web Letter spacing unit em rem Conversion ratio (Tracking value in px / font size in sp) = letter spacing (Tracking value in px / font size in sp) = letter spacing
- Letter spacing examples Android Web (.2 tracking / 16sp font size) = 0.0125 em (.2 tracking / 16px font size) = 0.0125 rem
- Applying type
- The Material 3 type scale organizes styles into five roles that are named to describe their purposes: display, headline, title, label, body. Each role has three sizes: large, medium, and small. These roles and sizes create clear page hierarchy and work across many devices.
- Roles
- Display There are three display styles in the default type scale: Large, medium, and small. As the largest text on the screen, display styles are reserved for short, important text or numerals. They work best on large screens. For display type, consider choosing a more expressive font, such as a handwritten or script style. If available, set the appropriate optical size to your usage.
- Headline Headlines are best-suited for short, high-emphasis text on smaller screens. These styles can be good for marking primary passages of text or important regions of content. Headlines can also make use of expressive typefaces, provided that appropriate line height and letter spacing is also integrated to maintain readability.
- Title Titles are smaller than headline styles, and should be used for medium-emphasis text that remains relatively short. For example, consider using title styles to divide secondary passages of text or secondary regions of content. For titles, use caution when using expressive fonts, including display, handwritten, and script styles.
- Body Body styles are used for longer passages of text in your app. Use typefaces intended for body styles, which are readable at smaller sizes and can be comfortably read in longer passages. Avoid expressive or decorative fonts for body text because these can be harder to read at small sizes.
- Label Label styles are smaller, utilitarian styles, used for things like the text inside components or for very small text in the content body, such as captions. Buttons, for example, use the label large style.
- Typesetting
- Vertical typesetting relies on padding, bounding boxes, and baselines to ensure text legibility at any size. Take engineering considerations and the conventions of your platform into account when making decisions for typesetting, text resizing, density, and using text in adaptive layouts.
- Using padding and bounding boxes Use this method for web products, and iOS products, where applicable. Note that some design tools also use bounding boxes for typesetting, but their methods vary and will need to be reconciled with the engineering implementation.
- In web UIs, the line height and bounding box height are the same. Text is vertically centered within the bounding box, following the " half-leading " behavior established by CSS. The vertical position of the text isn't controlled directly, but through the combination of the bounding box and font metrics.
- Padding is the space between UI elements, such as between an image and a bounding box, or between the inner edge of the bounding box and the text.
- Specify the distance of UI elements from fixed reference points, such as the container edge. For the web, automate this calculation using Sass or CSS.
- Line height Measure the height of the bounding box.
- Centering Ensure equal top and bottom padding around the inner edge of the bounding box by using center align
- Spacing Use the height of the bounding box, and top and bottom padding to determine spacing
- Using the baseline Use this method for Android products or platform-agnostic specs.
- The baseline is the invisible line upon which a line of text rests. In Material Design, the baseline is an important specification in measuring the vertical distance between text and an element.
- For Android, specifying distances relative to baseline enables accurate implementation. The baseline can also be used to communicate text position between designers in a way that's agnostic to the platform or design tool.
- Line height Measure distance from the text baseline of one line to the text baseline of the next line
- Centering Specify center alignment as a reference instead of measuring the distance to the text baseline
- Spacing Use the distance from a reference point to the text baseline
- Ensuring readability
- Line height Line height is the space between each line of text and is directly connected to type size. Material's type tokens are optimized for intended size and use.
- Tabular numbers Use tabular figures (also known as monospaced numbers) rather than proportional digits in tables or places where values may change often, such as clocks. Use monospaced tabular numbers to keep values optically aligned for better scanning.
- Using Material Symbols with typography
- Properly aligning typography with Material Symbols can improve cohesion and unity in your product. Learn more about matching icons and text
- Accessibility
- Color & contrast Support visual accessibility by choosing the appropriate color contrast between your product's text and background. Contrast is the perceived difference between the lightness or darkness of two colors, and is quantified by a contrast ratio .
- 3:1 for large text
- 4.5:1 for small text
- The default color for typography is on surface , although on surface variant is a strong alternative.
- For hyperlinked text appearing on top of a surface color, use primary. However, tertiary can be used to make links less prominent. Hyperlinked text must also be underlined.
- Scaling type
- Maintain hierarchy and scaling across devices by modifying certain elements as you scale. Scaling from watch to mobile : Increase the size of headlines , display , and body . Scaling from mobile or tablet to desktop: Increase the size of display and headline .
- When scaling between a desktop and TV display, increase the size of headlines and body type.
- Multi-column scaling As your layout adapts to different device sizes, consider maintaining the focus of an area by increasing the type size of that element. This example shows a column configuration scaling from a closed mobile device to an unfolded mobile device. The most prominent card (1) scales to maintain hierarchy.
- (removed per b/304969883) Line length Line length is how many characters are on a single line of text. For longer body text, the recommended line length is between 40 to 60 characters. For shorter lines of text, the ideal length is 20 to 40 characters.
- Editorial treatments
- Editorial treatments are standalone, showcase moments driven by type. They involve dynamic, attention-grabbing use of custom sizes, which can involve larger display type or a blockier look and feel. They should depart from purely functional layouts or basic stages in a user flow. In the expressive system, editorial treatments can be combined with elements such as motion, shape, or color, to create product-wide hero moments.
- Examples of editorial treatments
- Use editorial treatments in three key ways: to celebrate content, to highlight the voice of the user, or to draw attention to bespoke functionality within the product.
- Celebrating content Editorial treatments can dramatically take over the screen to mark a particular user action, memory, or preference. Try matching the text to the tone of the product or a strong emotion, like a narrow, thin style for serenity, or a bolder, italicized style for liveliness.
- Voice of the user Express the voice of the user by letting them personalize the appearance of typography or by adjusting text based on their input. Use customization selectively to frame a user's mood and make it stand out.
- Bespoke functionality Editorial treatments can also be used to help express moments of unique functionality within the product experience.
- Editorial treatment best practices
- Ensuring consistency between similar-looking editorial moments, creating tokens for each where needed
- Matching the emotional tone of text to the task at hand
- Not mixing multiple or clashing styles in the same layout
- Not mimicking personalization theming
- Use variable axes to make editorial treatments Adjust variable font axes like weight, grade, width, and optical size to match the font to the feeling. Baseline and emphasized type styles can still be used. Though, editorial treatments shouldn't be used in labels or just to give information.
- Weight Weight is the primary attribute that defines the overall thickness of a typeface's strokes in any given font. The most common weights are regular and bold, but weights can cover extremes from the very light to the very heavy. If the typeface is variable, it provides a full, continuous range of stroke thicknesses, making the number of weights effectively unlimited. Learn more about weight on Google Fonts
- Grade Grade is a secondary modifier of a typeface's optical weight, independent of the weight axis. Both weight and grade axes affect a letter's thickness, but adjustments with grade are much more granular and don't change any letter widths or line breaks. Learn more about grade on Google Fonts
- Width Width is the result of how much horizontal space is taken up by a typeface's characters. A narrow width allows more characters to fit per line while a wider width may offer more personality. Learn more about width on Google Fonts
- Optical size Optical sizes are different versions of a typeface optimized for use at different sizes. Small size designs focus on enhancing readability, while large size designs can show off the intricacies of the letter forms and offer many more weights and widths. Learn about choosing typefaces that have optical sizes.
