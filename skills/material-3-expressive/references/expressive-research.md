Scope
Google Design research summary on expressive UI. Covers a multi-year research effort, key findings, and measured impacts on usability, preference, and emotional response.

Key points
- Reports 46 research studies with more than 18,000 participants and hundreds of designs.
- Describes the origin of the initiative as a cross-functional inquiry (research, design, engineering) to increase emotional impact without losing usability.
- Defines expressive design as the use of color, shape, size, motion, and containment to create emotion and clarity.
- Notes that these expressive fundamentals also strengthen usability by drawing attention to key actions and grouping related elements.
- Finds that expressive design is preferred across age groups, with especially strong preference among younger users.
- Reports preference rates of 79% across all ages and up to 87% among 18-24-year-olds.
- Notes that expressive designs score higher on attributes like energetic, creative, playful, and friendly.
- Reports improvements in desirability signals vs non-expressive versions: modernity +34%, subculture relevance +32%, rebelliousness +30%.
- Reports usability gains: participants spotted key UI elements up to four times faster and tap time decreased by seconds in tested flows.
- Notes that expressive layouts can reduce age-related gaps in visual search performance.
- Warns that breaking familiar patterns (e.g., removing labels or standard list behavior) harmed usability.
- Emphasizes that expressiveness is not one-size-fits-all; some users prefer calmer variants and context matters.
- Points to M3 Expressive design scales, tactics, and updated guidelines for practical application.

Research methods
- Eye tracking to analyze attention.
- Surveys and focus groups to gauge emotional response.
- Experiments to gather sentiment and preferences.
- Usability testing to measure comprehension and task performance.

Component-level research examples
- Progress indicators: tested for perceived waiting time while matching premium device expectations.
- Button size: tested for faster tap times without overwhelming other content.
- Floating toolbar: optimized for modern, clean, energetic, noticeable, and usable design.
- Accessibility checks exceeded baseline standards for tap targets and contrast in many cases.

Usability case study highlights
- Email case study: a larger Send button placed above the keyboard in a secondary color was spotted ~4x faster than a small top-app-bar button.
- Expressive layouts helped older users (45+) match younger users in fixation times across 10 apps.
- Larger buttons and clear containment improved ease of use for people with diverse movement and visual abilities.

Context and caution
- Expressive UI should not override core usability or expected patterns.
- An unstructured album-art grid for playlists tested as modern-looking but reduced usability.
- Removing text labels from email actions reduced usability, even if visuals felt more expressive.
- Users can be less familiar with new expressive patterns; adoption will improve but requires careful rollout.

Get started guidance
- Start experimenting with the updated Material 3 Design Kit for Figma.
- Apply expressive tactics while supporting core user journeys.
- Be intentional with intensity: some users prefer calmer variants.
- Prioritize functionality and accessibility in all expressive decisions.
- Use design scales and iterative research to find the right balance.

How to use
- Use this as evidence when justifying expressive choices in a design brief or stakeholder review.
- Use the quantified findings to prioritize hierarchy, primary actions, and screen focus.
- Use the cautions to set limits on novelty in navigation and critical flows.
- Use the recommendations to balance freshness with familiarity and to tune expressive intensity.
