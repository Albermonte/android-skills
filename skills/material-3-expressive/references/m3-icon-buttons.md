- Icon buttons must use a system icon with a clear meaning Two types: default and toggle Many configurations: Color, size, width, and shape On web, display a tooltip describing the action while hovering In toggle buttons, use the outlined style of an icon for the unselected state, and the filled style for the selected state
- Default and toggle (selection)
- Color styles are now configurations. (filled, tonal, outlined, standard)
- Round and square options
- Shape morphs when pressed
- Shape morphs when selected

- Color values are implemented through design tokens. For designers, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens; in implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. There are four built-in color styles: filled, tonal, outlined, and standard. Default and toggle buttons use different color roles per style.
- star Note: These color roles were chosen to create design coherence and familiarity. Other color roles can be used as long as the container and text have a 3:1 contrast ratio. For example, tertiary and on tertiary.

- States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element. State layers slightly change button color. Disabled states have different base colors. View tokens for details
- Filled button states Default
- Tonal button states Default
- Outlined button states Default
- Standard icon button states
- The standard icon button's container is invisible at rest, but visible when the state layer is applied.
- Pressed state While pressed, icon buttons can morph to become more square. Both round and square icon buttons should have the same pressed shape radius. The corner radius value differs for each button size. See full icon button corner measurements
- When selected In addition to changing shape when pressed, toggle icon buttons also change the resting shape from round (unselected) to square (selected) by default. If the resting shape is square, the selected shape should be round.
- Target sizes Extra small and small icon buttons must have a target size of 48x48dp or larger to be accessible.
- Button corner radius
- XS S M L XL A. Round button Full Full Full Full Full B. Square button 12dp 12dp 16dp 28dp 28dp C. Pressed state 8dp 8dp 12dp 16dp 16dp
- Use the table's menu to select a token set. Only filled, tonal, and outlined icon button tokens are deprecated. Standard tokens are still available in the module at the top of the page.
- Default icon buttons can open other elements, such as a menu or search.
- Toggle icon buttons can represent binary actions that can be toggled on and off, such as favorite or bookmark .
- Color There are four icon button color styles, in order of emphasis: Filled Tonal Outlined Standard For the highest emphasis, use the filled style. For the lowest emphasis, use standard.
- Use a filled, tonal, or outlined icon button when the button needs more visual separation from the background. Choose the right style and emphasis for the situation.
- Use the filled style for visual impact and key actions that require high emphasis. Avoid overusing the filled style on a screen. Use them sparingly.
- Use the tonal style as a middle ground between filled and outlined icon buttons. It's useful for secondary actions paired with a high emphasis action. For example, use the tonal style for actions like Raise hand in a video meeting. When selected, its visual emphasis is greater than the outlined menu button, but less than the filled End call button.
- Use the outlined style for medium-emphasis buttons. It's useful when the button isn't the main focus of the interaction, such as browsing through sets of cards. Use the standard style for low-emphasis buttons, or when placing buttons on a colorful surface.
- Extra small - 32dp
- Small - 40dp (default)
- Medium - 56dp
- Large - 96dp
- Extra large - 136dp
- Not all icon buttons will need to emphasize a primary and secondary action. When buttons have a similar importance, they should be the same size.
- Icon Icons visually communicate the button's action. Their meaning should be clear and unambiguous. Browse popular icons Default icon buttons should use filled icons. Toggle buttons should use an outlined icon when unselected, and a filled version of the icon when selected.
- Icon accessibility requirements For selected toggle buttons, if a filled version of an icon doesn't exist, increase the icon weight to semibold. If semibold doesn't provide enough visual change, use bold. This is to ensure that selection is communicated through at least two properties, rather than just color. This requirement doesn't apply to default non-toggle buttons.
- Container The container provides increased contrast and hierarchy in places that need more visual separation from the background or other elements.
- Icon buttons are commonly used in other components, such as app bars and cards. These buttons should be used for common, easily understandable actions. Only use a few icon buttons at once.
- In dense layouts, group popular actions by placing many icon buttons next to each other in components like a toolbar or button group. These components draw attention or add interaction between buttons.
- Hover On hover, the icon button displays a tooltip describing its action, rather than the name of the icon itself.
- The icon should become filled to represent selection. If a filled version of the icon doesn't exist, use semibold weight instead.
- Understand meaning of the icon
- Navigate to and activate an icon button
- When applicable, a tooltip should be available to help describe the icon button's purpose
- Interaction & style
- Ensure the icon has contrast of at least 3:1 with the surface or background.
- Keys Actions Tab Focus lands on (non-disabled) icon button Space or Enter Activates the (non-disabled) icon button
- The accessibility label for icon buttons describes the action the button is executing, such as Add to favorites , Bookmark , or Send message .
- Layout & density
- Groups of similar components can be nested together inside a component, or they can stand alone. The target size of each icon button should be at least 48dp, even when nested.
- Avoid applying density by default Don't apply density to icon buttons by default. This lowers their targets below the required 48x48 CSS pixels minimum size. Provide density options that allow people to choose a higher density, such as selecting a denser layout or changing the theme. Controls for adjusting density must maintain a target size of at least 48x48 CSS pixels.
- On web, icon buttons should display a tooltip with an accessibility label.
