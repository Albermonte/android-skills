Scope
Applies Material 3 Expressive design language to Wear OS, covering color, typography, shapes, and motion.

Key points
- Uses expressive color and typography to create emotions such as playful, creative, or calm, while adapting to user context.
- Uses variable fonts for smooth weight, width, and optical sizing shifts that keep text readable across sizes.
- Adds five expressive type roles (arc headline, arc title, arc subtitle, arc body, arc caption) to support curved and radial layouts.
- Emphasizes edge-hugging, asymmetric, and overlapping shapes to create dynamic layouts and focal points.
- Encourages shape morphing (chips to cards, cards to buttons) to create fluid transitions.
- Applies motion to highlight key actions and help users understand relationships between elements.

How to use
- Use this for Wear OS UI decisions when adapting expressive tactics to circular or compact screens.
- Pull type role guidance when working with curved text layouts.
