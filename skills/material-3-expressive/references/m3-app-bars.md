- An image or logo
- A filled icon button
- The search app bar can include trailing actions inside and outside the search bar. When the search bar is selected, it should open the search view component.
- Image An image can be placed in the app bar. In small app bars, this can replace the label text.
- Filled trailing icon button The app bar's trailing icon buttons can be replaced with a single, primary, or tonal filled icon button in default or wide sizes.
- Color Color values are implemented through design tokens. For design, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. For implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. Learn more about design tokens All app bars share the same color roles. On scroll, the container changes color to surface container .
- Search app bar
- Small app bar
- Medium flexible app bar
- Large flexible app bar
- Deprecated app bars
- The medium and large app bars are deprecated in the expressive update. Use the medium flexible and large flexible app bars in their place.
- Select a token set to view in the table's menu. Deprecated app bar token sets are organized into a medium, large, and older deprecated token sets. Learn about design tokens

- Medium app bar
- Large app bar
- Use an app bar to provide content and actions related to the current page, such as page navigation actions, headlines, images, and 1-2 essential actions. The information and actions in the app bar should be contextual and specific to a page, but can also include global product controls, such as search or notifications.
- App bars should only have one action, two if necessary. The primary action should alter or exit the entire page, like Send , Save , or Edit . If the product has many actions, place those in a toolbar. Avoid placing an overflow menu in the app bar when possible.
- To boost visibility of a primary action, change the style of the icon button to filled or tonal, and consider using a wide icon button. Avoid using multiple filled or tonal buttons.
- Search app bar Use on home pages when search is key to the product.
- Small Use in dense layouts or when a page is scrolled.
- Medium flexible Use to display a larger headline. It can collapse into a small app bar on scroll.
- Large flexible Use to emphasize the headline of the page.
- Medium Replace with medium flexible.
- Large Replace with large flexible.
- Use a search app bar to provide an emphasized entry-point to open the search view.
- Searching a specific area Example: Search inbox
- Search [Product] Example: Search Photos
- Buttons in search app bar In addition to a trailing avatar, search app bars can have up to two trailing icons on mobile. Trailing icons can be placed inside or outside the search bar.
- The leading element of a search app bar can be used for a product's logo to brand the app's overall experience. This logo can be purely cosmetic, or can trigger an action like returning to the home screen or refreshing it. Avoid using a logo to open an expanded navigation rail.
- Don't use more than two trailing icon buttons with an avatar. If more actions are needed, place them in a toolbar instead.
- Alternate color options By default, search containers in app bars use the surface container color to distinguish it from the app background. If the background is darker, use a lighter container color on the search bar, like surface bright . When choosing alternate colors, make sure the search text and container have at least 3:1 contrast for readability.
- Container The app bar container holds all information and actions at the top of a screen, including navigation icons, headlines, and buttons. Avoid changing the position or shape of the container.
- Always use the default height of the app bar, and make it span the full width of the window.
- Adding logos Image logos can be used in app bars to bolster brand identity or visual appeal. The image should be high quality and pertinent, and shouldn't disrupt the app bar's functionality.
- A menu icon, which opens a modal expanded navigation rail
- A back arrow, which returns to the previous screen
- The current page
- The current section
- Headlines can be aligned to the leading edge or centered. The headline's typography size and style change depending on the type of app bar.
- Subtitle Subtitles can add additional context to a page. These can be leading-aligned or center-aligned with the headline text.
- Trailing icon buttons Up to two icon buttons can be placed after the headline, aligned to the trailing edge of the app bar. Place most-used actions closest to the leading edge. Avoid using these buttons to open a menu with more actions. If more actions are needed, place them in a toolbar instead. If changing the icon button color style to filled or tonal, only use one icon button.
- Use filled icons when possible for the best visibility. Outlined icons can also be used, particularly for unselected toggle buttons.
- Resizing The width of the app bar container responds to the view or device width. It should always span 100% of the window width.
- Resizing may cause actions at the trailing edge of the app bar to collapse into an overflow menu at smaller window sizes. These actions become visible again at larger sizes.
- The search container of the search app bar should fill 100% of the space between leading and trailing app bar elements until it reaches 312dp. Then, it should only grow further to fill 50% of that space.
- Presentation The app bar automatically supports right-to-left (RTL) languages by aligning the layout of elements to the leading and trailing edges of the container. This means that in RTL languages, the layout of the app bar is mirrored.
- Scrolling App bars should initially be the same color as the background, then fill with a contrasting color on scroll to provide visual separation from the background. The app bar can remain on a page at all times, or can hide and reappear when scrolling.
- Selecting the search bar should open the search view component.
- When scrolled, medium flexible and large flexible app bars can transform into small app bars. They should remain small until the page is scrolled back to the top. Don't transform app bars into a search app bar .
- star Note: This is a rapidly changing space. Guidelines are primarily intended for designers at this time. Find what's implemented in code in the design kit .
- Extended reality (XR) interfaces have special design requirements, like showing apps in 3D space. Material has an XR-specific app bar with custom specs and guidance. See XR developer documentation for more details.
- Types & configurations
- There is one app bar orbiter. It closely aligns with the small app bar. It can be configured to be center-aligned or left-aligned.
- Color & elevation
- XR uses color to communicate the elevation of UI elements and orbiters. With spatial elevation , the app bar displays above the spatial panel on the Z-axis. Elevated app bars can use any of these color options:
- An app bar can appear in an orbiter for a more immersive experience. Currently, this spatial capability is only available in full space. In home space, use a regular app bar on the same plane as the body content to mimic a 2D experience.
- Global context When placed in global context, the orbiter is centered at the top of the app it controls. It stays anchored to the app during layout or content changes. This ensures navigation elements are always easy to find and use.
- Local context When placed in local context, the orbiter is centered at the top of the spatial panel it controls. It repositions in response to layout or content changes.
- Additional app bars In most cases, apps should only have one app bar orbiter, placed in global context.
- Offset and inset positioning
- Spatial panel alignment By default, app bar orbiters are center-aligned to the spatial panel. Their width and placement can be adjusted to accommodate specific user needs, such as improved ergonomics or right-to-left (RTL) languages.
- Width boundaries An app bar orbiter's width should adjust to stay in a person's field of view . This makes crucial navigation elements easy to find.
- It's not recommended to increase the width of an app bar orbiter beyond a person's natural field of view . This creates a visual imbalance and makes it difficult to find navigation elements.
- Adaptable width When placed in local context, an app bar orbiter can expand to the width of its adjacent spatial panel. Be sure the orbiter stays in a person's field of view, and test for usability.
- XR accessibility guidelines are still evolving. XR app bars should follow applicable Material app bar accessibility standards .
- Understand what page they're currently visiting
- Take actions or navigate to a new page destination
- Maintain access to app bar actions when the content is scrolled
- Interaction & style
- Touch When tapping on an icon button, a touch ripple appears, indicating interaction feedback.
- Cursor When hovered, the hover state provides a visual cue to the user that the element is interactive. When clicked (in both active and inactive states), a ripple appears to indicate feedback.
- Keyboard or switch When navigating to an interactive element, a focus indicator appears to show that action can be taken. When the element is selected, an action is then performed.
- Initial focus Focus should initially land on the leading button, since it's the first interactive element of the app bar.
- Search container: surface container
- Search label: on surface variant
- Keyboard navigation Keys Actions Tab Move focus to the next interactive element Space or Enter Activate the focused element
- The accessibility label for a title should be the same as the content within the title. If needed, add additional context to the accessibility label to ensure users understand what page they're on or what content is being shown. Screen readers will read the UI text followed by the component's role.
- Label icon buttons according to their accessibility guidelines .
