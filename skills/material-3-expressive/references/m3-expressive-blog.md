- Frames M3 Expressive as an evolution of Material 3, not a new version or replacement.
- States it is the most researched update since 2014 (46 studies, 18,000+ participants).
- Lists research takeaways: expressive designs are preferred across ages, score higher on playful/energetic/creative/friendly attributes, increase likelihood of switching to expressive products, and improve findability of key UI elements (up to 4x faster).

What's in the update
- Expressive components: 14 new or updated components with more configuration, shapes, and emphasized text.
  - App bars, button groups (new), common buttons, extended FAB, FAB menu (new), FABs, icon buttons, loading indicator (new), navigation bar, navigation rail, progress indicators, sliders, split button (new), toolbars (new).
- Expressive styles:
  - Motion-physics system with spatial and effects springs.
  - Emphasized typography and updated type scale for stronger hierarchy.
  - Expanded shape library (35 shapes) and shape morph animation.
  - Vibrant color schemes and broader palette range.
- Expressive tactics (design guidance):
  1. Use a variety of shapes.
  2. Apply rich and nuanced colors with clear contrast.
  3. Guide attention with typography.
  4. Contain content to emphasize priority.
  5. Add fluid, natural motion.
  6. Leverage component flexibility for context and device size.
  7. Combine tactics into a limited number of hero moments.

Tactics detail and cautions
- Shapes: mix round and square silhouettes; use corner radius contrast to create focus. Caution: smaller shapes can make essential actions look less important. Do: break from the surrounding shape style to draw attention.
- Color: mix primary/secondary/tertiary roles and surface tones to establish hierarchy. Caution: low contrast makes elements blend. Do: use contrast to emphasize the main takeaway.
- Typography: use emphasized styles (weight, size, color, spacing) to direct attention and create editorial moments for key actions and information.
- Containment: group related content with spacing, size, and surface emphasis. Caution: ungrouped information blends together. Do: group similar content into informative clusters.
- Motion: use motion springs and micro animations to make interactions feel alive; apply shape morphing or surface effects to connect states.
- Flexibility: adapt components to user context and device form factor, using canonical layouts for foldables and large screens.
- Hero moments: combine multiple tactics to create a focused, emotional highlight. Keep hero moments brief and limited (1-2 per product). Validate against two questions: is it emotionally impactful, and is it a key interaction that benefits from emphasis.
