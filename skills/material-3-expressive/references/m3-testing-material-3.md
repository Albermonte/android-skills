Scope
Material Design research article describing how the team evaluated Material 2 vs Material 3, the questions used to measure perception, and the results of comparative testing.

Key points
- Published May 13, 2024.
- Defines three key dimensions UI should communicate: hierarchy, utility, and style.
- Uses structured survey questions to compare designs at scale, enabling rapid comparisons across many sample contexts.
- Emphasizes that usability tests measure behavior, while these surveys measure first impressions and perception.

Measurement framework
- Hierarchy: how effectively the design draws attention to important features and how informative the layout feels.
- Perceived utility: whether the design is obvious to use and has a clear main function.
- Style: how modern, clean, visually appealing, energetic, emotive, playful, friendly, creative, and personality-driven the design feels.

Study details
- Example experiment: 229 US-based participants comparing Material 2 vs Material 3 in an email app.
- Scores reflect estimated percent of participants who would prefer a design for each question.

Results summary (email app study)
- Hierarchy: 81% said Material 3 guided attention better; 92% said it was more informative.
- Perceived utility: 77% said Material 3 was more obvious to use; 76% said its main function was clearer.
- Style: 63% said Material 3 was more creative; 63% preferred its personality.
- One metric favored Material 2: 65% found Material 2 more playful.

Design implications noted
- Larger Compose buttons with text labels may improve visibility and obviousness.
- Emphasizing participant names in conversation lists can strengthen hierarchy.
- Larger search bars can improve discoverability vs small icon buttons.
- More colorful app bars can increase perceived playfulness.

How to use
- Use this to justify expressive hierarchy and utility changes with measurable perception outcomes.
- Use the hierarchy/utility/style framework when writing design briefs or review criteria.
